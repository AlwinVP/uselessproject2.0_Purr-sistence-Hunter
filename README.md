### Project Description
A totally useless VR game made for a hackathon, where you grab a cat, throw it as far as you can, and race it back to its starting point‚Ä¶ only to lose every single time.
The cat always runs (or teleports) back faster than you, no matter what you do. Built in Unity 6 with XR Interaction Toolkit.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
A hunter lives with a black cat that always eats his hunted food.
The hunter tries to throw the cat far away into the forest to get rid of it.
No matter how far he throws the cat, it always returns home first.
In the game, the hunter‚Äôs goal is to reach home before the cat ‚Äî but the cat always arrives first.
The challenge is to design gameplay where the hunter attempts different strategies, yet the outcome is humorously inevitable: the cat¬†always¬†wins.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Create a VR game where the player (hunter) races to get home before the cat.
The cat moves faster, takes shortcuts, and always reaches first.
Hunter can run, jump, and throw the cat, but it always comes back ahead.
The fun is in trying different ways to win ‚Äî but the outcome is always the same:¬†the¬†cat¬†wins.
