# Purr-sistence-Hunter üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: ThisThat


### Team Members

### Project Description
A totally useless VR game made for a hackathon, where you grab a cat, throw it as far as you can, and race it back to its starting point‚Ä¶ only to lose every single time.
The cat always runs (or teleports) back faster than you, no matter what you do. Built in Unity 6 with XR Interaction Toolkit.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
A hunter lives with a black cat that always eats his hunted food.
The hunter tries to throw the cat far away into the forest to get rid of it.
No matter how far he throws the cat, it always returns home first.
In the game, the hunter‚Äôs goal is to reach home before the cat ‚Äî but the cat always arrives first.
The challenge is to design gameplay where the hunter attempts different strategies, yet the outcome is humorously inevitable: the cat¬†always¬†wins.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Create a VR game where the player (hunter) races to get home before the cat.
The cat moves faster, takes shortcuts, and always reaches first.
Hunter can run, jump, and throw the cat, but it always comes back ahead.
The fun is in trying different ways to win ‚Äî but the outcome is always the same:¬†the¬†cat¬†wins.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
### For Software:

**Languages Used:**
- C# (for game logic and interactions)

**Frameworks Used:**
- Unity 6 (game engine)
- XR Interaction Toolkit (for VR grab, throw, teleportation area and player interaction mechanics)

**Libraries Used:**
- UnityEngine.XR
- TextMeshPro (for any in-game text/UI)

**Tools Used:**
- Unity Editor
- Visual studio
- VR-compatible build tools (Oculus/Meta integration)

### For Hardware:

**Main Components:**
- VR Headset (Meta Quest / HTC Vive / Valve Index ‚Äì intended for deployment)
- VR Controllers (for grab, throw, and teleport actions)
- Device simulator

**Specifications:**
- PC capable of running Unity VR projects
- VR-ready GPU
- Minimum 8GB RAM

**Tools Required:**
- USB cable or Air Link (for headset connection during testing)
- Headset base stations (if using outside-in tracking)


### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
[Drive link of the app](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sEzeRcz65rJyZNA_TafXaLfomwvg6YTq?usp=drive_link)

# Run
[Downloas the folder or the zip from the drive and run it in a windows PC. The app is build for the PC with the device simulator but it can be used in VR headset]

### Project Documentation
*Game Mechanics*
Grab & Throw ‚Äì Use VR controllers to pick up the cat and toss it away.

Race to Origin ‚Äì After throwing, the player must reach the cat‚Äôs original spot (the grab point).

Cat‚Äôs Return ‚Äì Once released, the cat will instantly start returning to its original position at an unbeatable speed.

Win/Lose Conditions:

Player Wins ‚Äì Reach the spot before the cat (never happens, but it‚Äôs coded in).

Cat Wins ‚Äì The cat reaches the spot first (always happens).

*Controls*
Grab: Grip button (VR controller) or space + G keys

Throw: Release grip with a throwing motion

Teleport/Move: VR joystick or teleport controlsor space + W keys

*How to Play*
Grab the cat.

Throw it as far as you can.

Run or teleport back to where you first grabbed it.

Watch the cat beat you there.

Laugh, repeat.
